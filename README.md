# hello-world
A brief introduction of my future project:

I am a math student, and I am going to use this website to upload theory (with demonstrations, as posible as I can) and applications of mathematics.
The main goal of this project is we all learn about the topics explained here by reading the content (and improve it if it is not correct or totally accurate) and comments, or giving ideas.
Hope we have fan!
